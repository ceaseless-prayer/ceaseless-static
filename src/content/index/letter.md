## An Invitation to Joy
The story behind Ceaseless
</header>
I’ll be the first to admit that I can be pretty selfish. Prayer isn’t something you’d normally think of as self-centered, but there was a time in my life when I managed to make it about myself. All of my prayers were about me—my anxieties, my problems and my desires.

I wanted to pray for others too, but it was hard and usually felt impersonal. Also it’s overwhelming! There are just too many people and needs to keep track of, much less pray for. And, let’s be honest, I knew that I couldn’t count on self-discipline to manage prayer lists that in the past would quickly be forgotten.

I was thinking about my selfish prayer dilemma one day, when I realized that I had easy access to a list of people to pray for: my Facebook friends.

And instead of praying for everyone in general, I could specifically pray for a few friends each day, which would eventually lead me to pray for everyone, including friends who would never ordinarily ask me to.

I spent a few weekends building an app that integrated with Facebook and sent me an e-mail with several friends to pray for each day. After spending some time using it, I was surprised at how easy and helpful it was. Every morning, I would look forward to discovering who to pray for that day. In a couple of cases I even felt prompted to reconnect with friends I had not spoken to in awhile.

### Is it useful?
I named the product Ceaseless and shared it with my friends to see if it could help them too.

After about 6 months of praying for friends, I discovered that with 70 users we had prayed for over 20,000 people. Mind blown.

I did a bit of math to see how high this number could practically go.

Assuming everyone had completely unique friends ([math stuff here](http://www.ceaselessprayer.com/assets/downloads/ceaseless-required-size-estimate-v1.pdf)), 10 million Christians could pray for the 1.3 billion people on Facebook in less than 2 months. How? 3 friends a day. Beyond that, it isn’t hard to see that if we can do this for the 1.3 billion people on Facebook, we could also pray for the 7.2 billion people on earth.

This realization opened my mind to thinking of Ceaseless as more than a product. It could be the start of a something much bigger.

What would God do if we prayed for people we have never prayed for before? What might He do as we pray regularly for others with all the breadth and depth that he invites us to?

I’m excited to find out. You can too.

### How:
#### __Step 1: Pray for 3 friends a day__

Download Ceaseless for iPhone or iPad and start praying for 3 friends each day! Without you, a lot of your friends may not be prayed for. But it’s more than just a responsibility—I’ve found praying for others to be a refreshing source of joy and love as well.

#### __Step 3: Going above and beyond__

Finally, if God moves you to support this mission beyond just praying for your friends, please [let me know](#cta). It is my passion to see believers unleashed in using their gifts to advance the gospel and whether that be through financial investment, volunteer effort, collaboration, access to platforms to share the vision and inviting brothers and sisters to the task or anything else, I would be delighted to talk with you.

I close this letter with an invitation to joy.
Jesus said:
> “Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.” <br/> (John 16:24, NIV)

Paul also taught:
> “Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” <br/>(1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, ESV)

God wants us to be joyful and prayer is one way He shares His joy with us. Can you imagine the awesome experience of seeing God publicly respond to our prayers in ways we didn’t think were possible? Can you hear the inspiration of story after story of God’s abounding grace spreading to others through our prayers? Can you feel the deep satisfaction of knowing that God heard you and granted your request for someone else because He loves you?

The invitation to pray for others is nothing less than an invitation to joy. Let’s share it.


The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
