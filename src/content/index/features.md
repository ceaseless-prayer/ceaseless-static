      <h3>Enjoyable</h3>
      <p>Jesus said we would experience joy by asking and receiving in his name (John 16:24). Ceaseless helps you ask God for all the breadth and depth that he invites you to so you can experience the fullness of joy he promised. You can write out prayers in a journal and take notes so that you can remember your requests and His answers.</p>
