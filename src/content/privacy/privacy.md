## Privacy Policy
Here are a few fundamental principles:
* We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
* We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

Ceaseless respects your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

### Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Ceaseless collects non-personally-identifying information of the soft that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ceaseless' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ceaseless' visitors use its website. From time to time, Ceaseless may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Ceaseless also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Ceaseless only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Ceaseless choose to interact with Ceaseless in ways that require Ceaseless to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ceaseless gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors who sign up for Ceaseless must provide an email address. Ceaseless collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Ceaseless. Ceaseless does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics
Ceaseless may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Ceaseless may monitor the number of monthly active users or the total number of friends prayed for in a period of time. Ceaseless may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Ceaseless does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Ceaseless discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Ceaseless' behalf or to provide services available at Ceaseless' websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ceaseless' websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ceaseless will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations as described above, Ceaseless discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Ceaseless believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ceaseless, third parties or the public at large. If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your reqeust or to help us support other users.
Ceaseless takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Ceaseless uses cookies to help Ceaseless identify and track visitors, their usage of Ceaseless, and their website preferences. Ceaseless visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Ceaseless, with the drawback that certain features of Ceaseless' website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers
If Ceaseless, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the event that Ceaseless goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Ceaseless may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Privacy Policy Changes
Ceaseless may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Ceaseless' sole discretion. Ceaseless encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
