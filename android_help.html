      <p>Ceaseless is an app that helps you pray for others by connecting to your contacts list and showing you 3 people to pray for every day.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-this-app-">How do I use this app?</h2>
<p>When you open the app, you will see a Scripture related to prayer to help you think about what God wants in your relationship with him.</p>
<p>After meditating on the text, swipe to the next card, which will show you someone to pray for. In addition to praying, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a note</li>
<li>Favorite them (which means they appear more frequently)</li>
<li>Send them a message</li>
<li>Remove them from Ceaseless</li>
<li>Invite them to use Ceaseless</li>
</ul>
<p>Just tap on the person&#39;s picture for a full list of available actions.</p>
<p>After swiping through all the people to pray for on that day, you will see your progress praying for the people in your address book. You can tap &quot;Show more people&quot; to get more people to pray for. If there are any announcements, you will see them listed on this card as well. Tapping on the announcement will open a view with more details.</p>
<p>Come back the following day to see who to pray for next!</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-want-it-">Why do I want it?</h2>
<p>When was the last time you promised to pray for someone and forgot to? With Ceaseless that doesn&#39;t need to happen again. Every day the app shows you a few people to pray for accompanied by your notes from conversations with them. So the next time someone asks you to pray, look them up in Ceaseless and add a note. The next time they show up you&#39;ll know what to ask and how to follow up with them.</p>
<p>By regularly praying for others over the long term, you can experience the joy of seeing God bless others as you have asked Him to. This applies to friends who normally wouldn&#39;t ask you to pray for them too! What might God do as we pray more and more for people who we don&#39;t usually remember? And what better way to love others than to take the first step of praying for them?</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-change-how-many-people-i-see-each-day-">How do I change how many people I see each day?</h2>
<p>To change how many people you get to pray for each day, tap on the Menu, then Settings, and change the count.</p>
<p><span id="remove-contact"></span></p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-remove-contacts-from-ceaseless-">How do I remove contacts from Ceaseless?</h2>
<p>To remove contacts from Ceaseless, tap on the Menu, then People. Tap the &quot;Edit&quot; button on the upper right and select all the people you want to remove from Ceaseless and then tap &quot;Remove&quot;. This will ensure they are not selected as contacts to pray for.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-add-people-to-pray-for-">How do I add people to pray for?</h2>
<p>Go to the Menu and select People. In the top right corner, tap the three dot symbol to add a contact. Fill in the necessary information and tap &quot;Done&quot;. A new contact will be created and you can then add notes in Ceaseless on how to pray for them.
Alternatively, you can add the contact directly to your address book.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-do-about-duplicate-contacts-">What do I do about duplicate contacts?</h2>
<p>Within Ceaseless, you can manually remove all versions of the contact except one. <a href="#remove-contact">Click here to learn how to remove contacts from Ceaseless.</a></p>
<h2 id="why-don-t-i-see-any-people-to-pray-for-">Why don&#39;t I see any people to pray for?</h2>
<p>Ceaseless requires permission to access your local device&#39;s address book. Please check your phone&#39;s settings to ensure you have given the app permission to your contacts.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-ceaseless-do-with-my-data-">What does Ceaseless do with my data?</h2>
<p>All of your data stays on your device. If your device is backed up to Google, then the Ceaseless application data may be included in that backup. The Ceaseless app itself does not store your contacts or notes in the cloud or share it with anyone.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-my-question-is-not-answered-here-">What if my question is not answered here?</h2>
