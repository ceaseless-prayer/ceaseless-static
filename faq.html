<section id="main" class="container">

  <section id="content" class="container">
    <section class="box">
      <h2 id="what-is-ceaseless-">What is Ceaseless?</h2>
<p>Ceaseless is a service that sends you an e-mail with 3 friends to pray for each day. We want to help followers of Jesus fulfill their priestly ministry of prayer.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-i-want-it-">Why do I want it?</h2>
<p>You&#39;re busy and it&#39;s hard to remember to pray for others. Prayer lists grow so long they start to feel overwhelming to the point of guilt-ridden indifference.</p></p>
<p>Ceaseless helps you overcome these problems by giving you something to look forward to each morning: a short list of people to pray for and their latest Facebook statuses. By helping you regularly pray for others over the long term, you can experience the joy of seeing God bless others as you have asked Him to.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it-">How do I use it?</h2>
<p>All you need to do is <a href="register.html">sign up</a>. At around 5am the next day you should receive an e-mail with a Scripture related to prayer and 3 friends to pray for. It takes less than 60 seconds to get set up.</p>
<h2 id="does-it-require-facebook-">Does it require Facebook?</h2>
<p>Yes for now Ceaseless requires a Facebook account since that is how it knows about your friends. We&#39;d like to enable you to join without Facebook, but don&rsquo;t have the resources to build that capability yet.</p>
<h2 id="does-ceaseless-post-anything-to-facebook-">Does Ceaseless post anything to Facebook?</h2>
<p>No, we know prayer is something Jesus taught us to do in secret (Matthew 6:5-6). Unlike other Facebook apps, it would be contradictory to trumpet every time you prayed for someone. Ceaseless needs access to Facebook mainly to get the list of your friends and their status updates and pictures.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-see-whom-i-pray-for-">Who can see whom I pray for?</h2>
<p>If you choose to allow it, the people you prayed for who also use Ceaseless could be informed when you prayed for them in the past week for their encouragement. And of course, as part of operating Ceaseless we can see whom you prayed for.</p>
<p>Eventually we want to do some number crunching to answer questions like who is in need of more prayer, but this feature doesn&#39;t exist yet and wouldn&#39;t be explicitly shared outside of our team.</p>
<h2 id="does-ceaseless-contact-anyone-">Does Ceaseless contact anyone?</h2>
<p>Ceaseless e-mails you each day, but it does not contact the people that you prayed for.</p>
<p>If you were asked to pray for someone who also uses Ceaseless, they are notified that you were asked to pray for them for their encouragement.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-ceaseless-decide-whom-to-ask-me-to-pray-for-">How does Ceaseless decide whom to ask me to pray for?</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re asking this question, you may want to get involved with the project &#9786;. Get in touch <a href="contact.html?subject=I want to get involved">here</a> </p>
<p>There are some really interesting algorithms and machine learning applications to be had. But to answer the question for now, Ceaseless follows a very rudimentary process: take the list of friends, sort it from the least &quot;prayed for&quot; to the most and send an e-mail with the 3 &quot;least prayed for&quot;. When you start, every friend has been &quot;prayed for&quot; 0 times, so it&#39;s a pseudo-random ordering.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-share-ceaseless-with-others-">How do I share Ceaseless with others?</h2>
<p>If you&#39;ve found Ceaseless helpful, we would absolutely appreciate your help sharing it with others. Go to <a href="share.html">this page</a> for easy sharing tools.</p></p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-support-ceaseless-">How can I support Ceaseless?</h2>
<p>You can support Ceaseless in four ways.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, please pray for us! Like you, we go through the ups and downs of life and sometimes question whether or not we are pursuing the Lord or our own ideas. Please pray that the Lord would encourage and strengthen us for the work he has given us to do. Please pray that we would honor him and effectively serve you with our work instead of merely seeking our own interests and advancement.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, please give us your feedback! We love to hear from our users about how Ceaseless is helping them fulfill their priestly ministry of prayer. We also want to know when things aren&#39;t working well or when you have any concerns or ideas. You can reach us <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, if you&#39;ve benefited from using Ceaseless, please share it with others! We want to help followers of Jesus pray for others amidst the busyness of daily life, but we cannot do so without your help sharing it. You can share with friends <a href="share.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, if you want to give money to support Ceaseless, you can do so <a href="donate.html">here</a>. We aren&#39;t an incorporated non-profit, so there are no tax benefits, but you can have the joy of investing in our team and this project as it helps promote God&#39;s desire that his people pray without ceasing.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>, (I know I said four ways, but I thought of one more!) if you have creative ideas for how you can help, like writing a review or sharing Ceaseless with your small group or church or conference, or writing code or something else, please <a href="contact.html?subject=I want to get involved">let us know here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-building-ceaseless-">Who is building Ceaseless?</h2>
<p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.meritandgrace.com/let-there-be-ceaseless-prayer/">brief post</a> on my personal blog when I started Ceaseless. Since then, the team has grown and an organization I&#39;m forming called <a href="http://www.theotech.org">TheoTech</a> is behind it. Feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/meritandgrace">Twitter</a> or <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
